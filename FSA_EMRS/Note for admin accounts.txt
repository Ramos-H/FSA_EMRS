The application doesn't actually have any hardcoded admin login credentials. In order to see the admin functionality, you need to create an admin account first.

In order to create an admin account, do the following steps:
1. If you haven't already, download the application source code by cloning the repository.
2. Go to SubPage_register2.vb then make sure that on line 59, isAdmin is being set to true.
3. Run the application and create a user account through the register form. The account created by this will have admin privileges.
4. You can now close the application or continue using it.
